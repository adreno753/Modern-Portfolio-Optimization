Modern Portfolio Optimization
This project implements modern portfolio optimization techniques to maximize returns while minimizing risk for a portfolio of financial assets. It focuses on applying mathematical models to optimize asset allocation based on historical market data.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the performance of individual assets and their correlations.
Mean-Variance Optimization: Use the Markowitz Efficient Frontier to identify optimal portfolios.
Risk Metrics: Calculate key risk metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, portfolio variance, and expected returns.
Portfolio Simulation: Simulate different portfolio compositions and visualize risk-return trade-offs.
Results
The project identifies the optimal portfolio that balances risk and return, offering investors a data-driven strategy for asset allocation.
